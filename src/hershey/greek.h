USE RESTRICTION:
This distribution of the Hershey Fonts may be used by anyone for
any purpose, commercial or otherwise, providing that:
	1. The following acknowledgements must be distributed with
		the font data:
		- The Hershey Fonts were originally created by Dr.
			A. V. Hershey while working at the U. S.
			National Bureau of Standards.
		- The format of the Font data in this distribution
			was originally created by
				James Hurt
				Cognition, Inc.
				900 Technology Park Drive
				Billerica, MA 01821
				(mit-eddie!ci-dandelion!hurt)
	2. The font data in this distribution may be converted into
		any other format *EXCEPT* the format distributed by
		the U.S. NTIS (which organization holds the rights
		to the distribution and use of the font data in that
		particular format). Not that anybody would really
		*want* to use their format... each point is described
		in eight bytes as "xxx yyy:", where xxx and yyy are
		the coordinate values as ASCII numbers.

(And yes, I know the format output here is rather
ironic looking at the comments above)
